Never give up,
Never lose hope.
Always have faith,
It allows you to cope.
Trying times will pass,
As they always do.
Just have patience,
Your dreams will come true.
So put on a smile,
You'll live through your pain.
Know it will pass,
And strength you will gain

If I could save time in a bottle
the first thing that I'd like to do
is to save every day until eternity passes away
just to spend them with you
If I could save time in a bottle
the first thing that I'd like to do
is to save every day until eternity passes away
just to spend them with you
If I could make days last forever
if words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
again I would spend them with you
